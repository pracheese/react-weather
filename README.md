This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The weather app shows the current temperature(in C) and the current weather condition of my location. It has a graph to show the temperature and real-feel over every 3 hrs of the next 5 days.

I have used recharts for graphs and learned about state and lifecycle methods.

I plan to allow the user to change the location and toggle between C and F for temperature.
